The concept of the "male gaze," as theorized by feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey, refers to the way in which the visual arts, particularly cinema, have traditionally represented the world from a patriarchal perspective, objectifying and sexualizing women for the pleasure and consumption of a male viewer. Similarly, biases codified into machine learning systems, or the "ML gaze," can be seen as a reflection of the biases and perspectives of those who design and train these systems.

Both the male gaze and the ML gaze reveal the ways in which power and privilege shape the way we see and understand the world. In the case of the male gaze, it is the power and privilege of the patriarchal society that shapes the way women are represented and perceived. In the case of the ML gaze, it is the power and privilege of those who design and train the systems, often white and male, that shape the way the systems perceive and interact with the world.

The consequences of the male gaze and the ML gaze are also similar in that they can reinforce and perpetuate existing societal inequalities. The objectification and sexualization of women in visual media can contribute to the devaluation and marginalization of women in society. Similarly, the codification of biases into machine learning systems can lead to discriminatory outcomes, such as in the case of facial recognition systems that perform poorly on people with darker skin tones.

The "ML gaze" becomes more concerning when considering new technologies like autonomous vehicles, predictive policing, and hiring or vetting algorithms. These systems are being designed to make decisions that can have serious and often life altering consequences, such as whether or not to arrest someone or who to hire for a job. If these systems are built with biases, they could perpetuate existing inequalities and discriminate against marginalized groups. This is compounded by the fact that many models are so-called "black boxes" whose decision system is opaque and unexplainable.

Both the male gaze and the ML gaze are rooted in the idea that there is a single, objective perspective from which to view the world. However, as Mulvey argues, there is no such thing as an objective gaze, as all perspectives are shaped by power and privilege. In the same way, it is important to recognize that there is no such thing as an unbiased machine learning system, as all systems are shaped by the biases and perspectives of those who design and train them.

It is crucial to acknowledge and address the ways in which the male gaze and the ML gaze shape our understanding of the world and to work towards creating more inclusive and equitable systems. This can be done by diversifying the teams who design and train these systems and by incorporating a feminist and anti-racist lens in the development process. Only by doing so, can we hope to move towards a more equitable and just society.
